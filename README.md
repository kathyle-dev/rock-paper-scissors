# A fun Pokemon-themed rock, paper, scissors game

This is a play on the class "rock, paper, scissors" game.
I used HTML, CSS and Javascript to create it.
It pits you against "Team Rocket", the computer, by randomly drawing a pokémon for you to battle.
It also posts your score so you can keep track of who's the Pokémon master and who needs more training!
